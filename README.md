### Welcome!

Support for this event has been overwelming with students registering and staff / PhDs volunteering. Thank you for being
part of this! As well as committing some code to the wild, this is also a great opportunity to network. Please help
each other, follow each other and stay in contact. Please feel free to work by yourself or in small teams.


### Getting Started

Many of you girls / guys will be new to open source, and that's absolutely amazing! Some of the most important software
in this world is Open Source. Getting started is always the hardest part. 
In order to get you started contributing as soon as possible, we've created a load of potential cheat sheets to work
on. See the issues tab. 

Cheat Sheets are a simple overview of a particular topic. I have noticed they are a good way to incubate new contributors
to DuckDuckHack and open source in general. They take about 40 - 120 minutes to create. Once you have created a cheat sheet
or two, (if you have time) please head over to the forum and check on the more advanced stuff that you can programme in 
Python, Perl, Ruby or JavaScript. See this: https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/duckduckhack-getting-started/53
