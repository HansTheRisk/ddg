### Welcome!

Support for this event has been overwelming with students registering and staff / PhDs volunteering. Thank you for being part of this! As well as committing some code to the wild, this is also a great opportunity to network. Please help each other, follow each other and stay in contact. Please feel free to work by yourself or in small teams.


### Getting Started

Many of you girls / guys will be new to open source, and that's absolutely amazing! Some of the most important software in this world is Open Source. Getting started is always the hardest part. In order to get you started contributing as soon as possible, we've created a load of potential cheat sheets to work
on. See the [issues tab](https://github.com/pjhampton/ddg/issues). 


### Your first PR

Cheat Sheets are a simple overview of a particular topic. I conjecture that they are a good way to incubate new contributors to DuckDuckHack and open source in general. They take about 40 - 120 minutes to create. 
This will get you comfortable with [git](https://git-scm.com/), [Github](https://github.com/) and [Codio](https://codio.com/).


### Your next PR

Once you have created a cheat sheet [or two, three, etc], please head over to the forum and check on the more advanced stuff that you can programme in either Python, Perl, Ruby or JavaScript. You can sign up to the forum with your github account here: https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/duckduckhack-getting-started/53

### FAQs

  1. I'm stuck with Git/Github/Codio.
  ```
  Ask Peter, Giuseppe or Stuart. Or better yet, someone around you. Teaching is a good method of reinforcement learning.
  ```

  2. Can I come up with my own idea for a Cheat Sheet.
  ```
  YES! This is encouraged. If you are considering creating a Fathead, please discuss it on the forum before making it.
  ```

  3. When do we get a DDG t-shirt?
  ```
  When they arrive, which will hopefully be **very** soon. One of us with call you to our office to give it to you.
  ```

  4. Can I join the DDG github organization?
  ```
  Yes, you will be added in time so we can allocate you to your tasks, other tasks you wish to work on etc.
  ```
